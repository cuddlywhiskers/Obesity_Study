# Obesity Study
The Untitled Obesity Study 

Obesity has been a prominent issue in the West. This project that aims to identify factors co-relating to the spike in obesity rates across America. Obesity, being a multi-dimensional issue, stems from a combination of factors and some of these key risk factors identified were (state level data): 
1. number of fast food chains, 
2. age groups, 
3. race, 
4. poverty rates, 
5. exercise rates and 
6. smoking rates. 

(1) Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:  Data first cleansed to aggregate observations at state level (2) Data Visualisation: Seaborn/ matplotlib on correlation values and linear regression model. (3) Data Analysis: Statistical tools were utitlise include, correlation studies, linear regression and multi-variable regression analysis. 

We hope that this analysis encourages more to deep dive into this issue and provide more in-depth studies betweenn these factors and obesity rates. Enjoy!
